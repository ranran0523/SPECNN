# SPENCNN

This is the implementation for ICML2023 paper: 

SpENCNN: Orchestrating Encoding and Sparsity for Fast Homomorphically Encrypted Neural Network Inference (https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/ran23b/ran23b.pdf)

# Installation

```PowerShell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

# HE-group convolution
By running the 3 ipynb file to perform group convolution replaced CNNs training.

# HE-inference Test
To use a multi-thread simulation environment on testing inference latency, we fork the code from HEAR(https://github.com/K-miran/HEAR).

# Acknowledgement
Code forked and modified from https://github.com/wanglouis49/pytorch-weights_pruning
